# Practice of of programming fundamentals and its concepts with examples

1. **Data Types & Variables:**
- Primitive Data Types: Integers, Floats, Booleans, Characters, Strings.
- Variables: Containers that store data values. Understanding scope (local vs. global), immutability, and the types of variables in different programming languages.

2. **Control Structures:**
- Conditional Statements: if, else if, else, switch for controlling the flow of the program based on conditions.
- Loops: for, while, do-while for repeating a block of code multiple times.

3. **Functions/Methods:**
- Function Definition & Invocation: Creating reusable blocks of code, passing parameters, and returning values. [Simple Functions Example](https://github.com/dwarkesh8/IT-fundamentals-and-revision/blob/main/programming/functions/simple-functions.js)
- Recursion: A function that calls itself, useful in problems like factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, etc. [Recursion Functions Example](https://github.com/dwarkesh8/IT-fundamentals-and-revision/blob/main/programming/functions/recursion-function.js)
- Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results (common in functional programming languages) [Higher Order Function Example](https://github.com/dwarkesh8/IT-fundamentals-and-revision/blob/main/programming/functions/higher-order-function.js)

4. **OOP (Object Oriented Progamming):**
- Class & Objects: Class is a blueprint that hold the configurations. And Object is an instance of a Class. [Class & Object Example](https://github.com/dwarkesh8/IT-fundamentals-and-revision/blob/main/programming/OOP/class-and-object.js)

- Inheritance: Mechanism where one Class (Child) inherits the attributes & methods of another Class (Parent). It can do mainly two things, Override & Reuse methods from Parent class. [Inheritance Example](https://github.com/dwarkesh8/IT-fundamentals-and-revision/blob/main/programming/OOP/inheritance.js)

- Polymorphism: It allows methods to behaves differently based on the object it is acting upon. In other words, same method name can have different functionality based on the object. [Polymorphism Example](https://github.com/dwarkesh8/IT-fundamentals-and-revision/blob/main/programming/OOP/polymorphism.js)
